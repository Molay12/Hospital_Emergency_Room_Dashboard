# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
- This project helped me gain valuable insights into data visualization, trend analysis, and decision-making in a hospital emergency room (ER) setting.
# Key Learnings from This Project:
- âœ… Patient Trends & Busy Days â€“ Counted total patients visiting the ER daily and used an area sparkline to spot peak days & seasonal trends.
- âœ… Wait Time Analysis â€“ Calculated the average time patients wait before seeing a medical professional and tracked daily fluctuations using an area sparkline to highlight days requiring operational improvements.
- âœ… Satisfaction Score Monitoring â€“ Analyzed average daily satisfaction scores to assess service quality. Used area sparklines to detect patterns, spot drops in satisfaction, and correlate them with busy times or operational challenges.
# Key Insights from the Dashboard:
- ðŸ“Œ Total Patients 
 -  ðŸ“Œ Admission Rate: admitted, not admitted
 -ðŸ“Œ On-Time Service: attended on time, faced delays
- ðŸ“Œ Gender Split: Female | Male
 - ðŸ“Œ Most Affected Age Group
 - ðŸ“Œ Referral Trends: patients had no referral, but General Practice and Orthopedics saw the highest referrals
