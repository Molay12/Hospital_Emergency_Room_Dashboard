# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
Key Learnings from This Project:
âœ… Patient Trends & Busy Days â€“ Counted total patients visiting the ER daily and used an area sparkline to spot peak days & seasonal trends.
âœ… Wait Time Analysis â€“ Calculated the average time patients wait before seeing a medical professional and tracked daily fluctuations using an area sparkline to highlight days requiring operational improvements.
âœ… Satisfaction Score Monitoring â€“ Analyzed average daily satisfaction scores to assess service quality. Used area sparklines to detect patterns, spot drops in satisfaction, and correlate them with busy times or operational challenges.
